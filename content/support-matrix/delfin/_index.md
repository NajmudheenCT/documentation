2. Access information to register storage: Table illustrates what all access protocol supported and parameters required to register the storage device.  
3. Alert management information : Type of alert sourcing and clearing supported
4. Performance registration information: Table illustrates the resources, and their default interval supported for performance collection.
5. Resource data matrix: Table illustrates the resources supported along with their available attributes.
6. Alert data matrix : Table illustrates fields available in the alert data
7. Performance metric data: Table illustrates performance metrics supported for each resource.
